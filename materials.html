		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>In the "Topic Materials" I decided to keep following the same line about Digital Service and FrontEnd because this is the 
		major that I chose. So, for this page, I included some links and information about tools that is helping me during this course
		and, specially, tools that helps me to create this page.</p>
		<p>So, bellow you can find links of websites and materials about flexbox, grid, semantic elements, float and layouts that I used to
		consult before start assignments and to learn a little more about this major. And for my "Eureka Moments", when I decide
		to do something completely new (for me, of course) and ran into Google to find answers.
		All these materials helped me to improve my skills in this couse and decide about my next steps in the BITE couse and 
		in my carrer.</p>

		<h2>A Complete Guide to Flexbox</h2>
		<p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space 
		among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.</p>

		<h2>Grid Layout</h2>
		<p>The vast majority of websites out there use a grid. They may not explicitly have a grid system in place, but if they have a 
		"main content area" floated to the left a "sidebar" floated to the right, it's a simple grid.</p>
		<p>If a more complex layout presents itself, people often reach for a grid framework. They assume grids are these super 
		difficult things best left to super CSS nerds. That idea is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of the grid systems they reach 
		for are very complicated.</p>

		<h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
		<p>Semantics, put simply, is the study of meanings. For you fans of linguistics, itâ€™s the study of the relationships among 
		signs, signifiers, and signifieds. So, in web design, a semantic element is an element that has intrinsic meaning, and 
		conveys that meaning to both the browser and the developer. For example, "tag div" and "tag span" are non-semantic elements. 
		They tell us nothing about their contents. But "form", "table", and "article" are semantic elements: They clearly 
		define their content. To enrich the semantic content of documents, HTML5 introduced several new page structure elements.</p>

		<h2>Float Layout</h2>
		<p>Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. 
		In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly 
		and appropriately called "text wrap".</p>
		<p>In page layout programs, the boxes that hold the text can be told to honor the text wrap, or to ignore it. 
		Ignoring the text wrap will allow the words to flow right over the image like it wasn't even there. This is the difference 
		between that image being part of the flow of the page (or not). Web design is very similar.</p>

		<h2>Layouts</h2>
		<p>Imagine that you want to create your own multicolumn web site. Where should you start from? After googling some, 
		you'll find dozens of tutorials and articles. It's good when there are plenty of possibilities, but it's a little bit hard 
		when you're a novice and don't even know what technique to choose. This article was written to help you with this important 
		decision.</p>
