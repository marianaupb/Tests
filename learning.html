		<h2>10 Skills You Need to Land Your First Front End Developer Job</h2>
		<p>These are all terms that will become super familiar to you as you start learning tech skills, but to ease you in, 
		here’s a digestible list (and description!) of 10 essential skills every front end developer needs.</p>
		<p>1. HTML/CSS = I know, these two terms keep coming up. There’s a good reason, though. You won’t find a single front end 
		developer job listing that doesn’t call for (or assume) proficiency in these two languages. But let’s take a step back and look 
		at what HTML and CSS are. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. A markup 
		language is your way of making notes in a digital document that can be distinguished from regular text. It’s the most basic 
		building block you’ll need for developing websites. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to present the 
		document you create with HTML. Where HTML comes first and creates the foundation for your page, CSS comes along next and is 
		used to create the page’s layout, color, fonts, and…well, the style! Both of these languages are absolutely essential to 
		being a front end developer. Simply put, no HTML/CSS, no web development.</p>
		<p>2. JavaScript/jQuery = Another MAJOR tool in your front end developer toolbox is going to be JavaScript (JS). 
		Where HTML is a markup language and CSS is a style sheet language, JS is the first language I’ve mentioned that’s a 
		bonafide programming language. What’s the difference? Where HTML and CSS determine the presentation of a page, JS 
		determines the function. In some instances a very simple website or web page is fine, but for situations where you 
		need interactive features—audio and video, games, scrolling abilities, page animations—JS is the tool you’ll use to 
		implement them (though as CSS evolves, it’s starting to handle a lot of these duties as well). One cool thing to 
		keep in mind about JS is the existence of libraries like jQuery, a collection of plugins and extensions that make 
		it faster and easier to use JS on your website. jQuery takes common tasks that require multiple lines of JS code 
		and compresses them into a format that can be executed with a single line. This will be a big help when you’re coding 
		with JS. Unless, of course, you don’t like saving time.</p>
		<p>3. CSS and JavaScript Frameworks = Wait, we already covered CSS and Javascript, right? We did, but they’re both such a 
		big part of front end development that a lot of other skills you’ll need are going to build off of them. CSS and 
		JavaScript frameworks are collections of CSS or JS files that do a bunch of the work for you by providing common 
		functionality (think logging into a website or searching a blog). Instead of starting with an EMPTY text document you 
		start with a code file that has lots of awesome JS already in it. Frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses—don’t 
		we all!—and it’s important to choose the best framework for the type of website you’re building. For example, some JS 
		frameworks are great for building complex user interfaces, while others excel at displaying all of your site’s content. To 
		make things even MORE fun you can use frameworks together. It’s common to pair Bootstrap with another JavaScript 
		framework like AngularJS. The content is handled by Angular, and the look & feel is handled by Bootstrap (with some 
		CSS sprinkled in, too). Since you’ll be using CSS and JS all the time in your web development, and since many 
		projects start with similar style elements and code, knowledge of these frameworks is critical to being an efficient developer.</p>

		<h2>HTML Basics</h2>
		<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, 
		content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.  
		As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

		<h2>What to know about CSS?</h2>
		<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. CSS Basics takes you through what you need to 
		get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make my text black or red? How do I make my content show up in such-and-such 
		a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>

		<h2>Understanding UX Design & Front-End Development</h2>
		<p>What is UX Design?</p>
		<p>The Wikipedia definition of UX: <i>"User experience design (UXD or UED) is the process of enhancing customer satisfaction and 
		loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the customer and 
		the product…".</i>Wikipedia.</p>
		<p>A UX Designer’s skills revolve around understanding who the user is, how the user thinks, and what the user needs.</p>
